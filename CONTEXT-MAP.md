# Context Map

Multi-context layout for the Virtality Platform monorepo. Each context has its own `CONTEXT.md` (created lazily by `/grill-with-docs`) and optionally `docs/adr/` for context-specific decisions.

| Context | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| console | `apps/console/` | Clinician/practitioner web app — patients, programs, presets, devices, VR casting, organizations, clinical forms |
| adminboard | `apps/adminboard/` | Internal admin dashboard — resource management (exercises, presets, maps, avatars, patients, users), referrals, email, S3 bucket |
| website | `apps/website/` | Public marketing site — landing, pricing, blog, case studies, waitlist, contact |
| ui-system | `packages/ui/` | Shared UI bucket for cross-app components and email templates consumed by multiple contexts |
| server | `services/server/` | Platform API — Hono server with tRPC/oRPC, auth middleware, user/device data |
| socket | `services/socket/` | Real-time communication — Socket.IO bridge between console frontend and VR headsets |

System-wide architectural decisions live in `docs/adr/` at the repo root.

Shared packages (`packages/db`, `packages/auth`, `packages/orpc`, `packages/ui`, etc.) are documented within the contexts that own them. The Prisma schema in `packages/db/console/prisma/` is the cross-context data-model source of truth.

The **Shared UI Bucket** (`packages/ui/`, `@virtality/ui`) is the canonical source for promoted cross-app UI primitives; see `packages/ui/CONTRACT.md`.
