# Adminboard

Internal admin dashboard for managing platform resources and operational content.

## UI patterns

When a dropdown menu item opens a dialog, follow `docs/adr/0002-dropdown-dialog-pointer-events.md` (controlled menu, `modal={false}`, defer dialog open via `useDropdownMenu`).

## Language

**Highlight Card**:
A landing-page content unit with a title, body copy, and a Lucide icon name. Style is owned by the website; Adminboard manages copy and icon selection only.
_Avoid_: Feature card, benefit card, info card

**Highlight Card Collection**:
An ordered set of Highlight Cards for one landing placement, such as Benefits or Features. Adminboard Content sections share one managing tool and differ only by which collection they edit.
_Avoid_: Card list, feature set, benefit set

**Bucket Object**:
A file-like asset stored in the platform media bucket and served through the Virtality CDN.
_Avoid_: S3 resource, file resource

**Object Key**:
The slash-separated, URL-safe name of a bucket object. Admin-created object keys keep a readable filename stem and include a unique suffix.
_Avoid_: File path, S3 path

**CDN URL**:
The public Virtality CDN address for a bucket object.
_Avoid_: File path, S3 URL

**Object Replacement**:
A content update that creates a new bucket object instead of changing the contents at an existing CDN URL.
_Avoid_: Overwrite

**Referenced Bucket Object**:
A bucket object whose CDN URL or object key is used by another platform resource.
_Avoid_: Attached file

**Folder**:
A navigational grouping of bucket objects by shared path-like location. Empty folders are not independent admin-managed things.
_Avoid_: Directory

**Folder Operation**:
An admin action applied to every bucket object in a folder.
_Avoid_: Folder CRUD

**Admin-authored Email**:
A marketing, newsletter, or announcement email composed by an Adminboard admin using Email Body Blocks.
_Avoid_: Custom template, HTML email

**System Email**:
A code-owned account or product email that changes infrequently and is not edited through the no-code builder.
_Avoid_: Transactional template

**Email Draft**:
A saved, editable Admin-authored Email that has not been final-sent.
_Avoid_: Template draft

**Sent Email Record**:
An immutable record created by Final Send, including the rendered snapshot and per-recipient delivery results.
_Avoid_: Sent message

**Email Body Block**:
A structured content unit in the no-code builder, such as Heading, Paragraph, Image, Button, List, Card, or Divider.
_Avoid_: Component, widget

**Email Brand Shell**:
The locked Virtality header, footer, and sender identity wrapped around admin-authored body content.
_Avoid_: Email layout, wrapper template

**Email Recipient List**:
The explicit list of recipient email addresses entered for a draft send.
_Avoid_: Audience, mailing list

**Email Test Send**:
A required pre-send delivery to verify the rendered email in a real inbox.
_Avoid_: Preview send

**Final Send**:
The immediate, irreversible send that creates a Sent Email Record.
_Avoid_: Blast send, publish

### Access and billing

**Tester Code**:
A one-time bearer staff-issued code, formatted `TE-` plus ten alphanumeric characters, that grants tester access when consumed at sign-up. It is a separate system from a **Free Redeem Code**; both use the same sign-up code field and the server routes by prefix. Adminboard issues and manages Tester Codes under Admin (not Billing).
_Avoid_: Referral Code, QA code, Testing Code, promo

**Free Redeem Code**:
A one-time bearer code, formatted `PAY-` plus ten alphanumeric characters, redeemed at sign-up in one of two modes: **Permanent Free** (`trialDays = 0`, no-card permanent Free seat) or **Timed trial** (positive `trialDays`, no-card **Trial Subscription**). Unused codes expire one week after creation. Staff may copy the code or send it with a **System Email**; the send recipient is delivery-only, not a bind. Default timed trial length is fourteen days with an optional per-code day override. When the clinician already has active Free (not entitled), a timed-trial code attaches the trial to that seat; paid Pro and live trials still consume as already entitled with no seat change. Empty codes and well-formatted codes that are not in the store do not create an account and send the clinician to the website waitlist; Expired and Already used block with error copy. It is a separate system from a **Tester Code**; both use the same sign-up code field and the server routes by prefix. Distinct from **Coupon**, **Promotion Code**, and **Discount**. Adminboard issues and manages Free Redeem Codes under Billing.
_Avoid_: Trial Redeem Code, Billing Code, Access Code, Customer Redeem Code

**Trial Subscription**:
A Subscription currently in its trial phase, started without requiring a card when configured that way.
_Avoid_: free sub, trialing subscription (as the term), trial offer

**Entitlement Clock**:
The single clock that determines whether the clinician may launch VR programs. When it is expired, VR program launch is blocked and the app stays usable. Stripe remains the source of truth for the underlying end time.
_Avoid_: trial_end (as product speak), access window, license timer, Seat, org seat, multi-seat

**Entitlement Standing**:
Server read model of the clinician's Entitlement Clock and related billing flags from synced Subscriptions (`buildEntitlementStanding`). Includes entitled, status, clockEnd, Billing Path Established, Paid billing history, Checkout CTA, pending Cycle plan change, and cancel-at-period-end.
_Avoid_: session entitlement blob, live countdown (that is Live Entitlement Standing)

**Live Entitlement Standing**:
Entitlement Standing re-evaluated at a client `now` for Remaining Time, VR soft gate, sidebar Checkout CTA, and related labels (`projectLiveEntitlementStanding`). Synced flags pass through; time-sensitive fields overwrite the standing values that went stale after the server `now`. Console owns the ticking hook and Checkout restore poll; this projection stays pure.
_Avoid_: client-side entitlement invent, dual-write clock, refetch-only countdown

**Billing Path Established**:
At least one synced local Subscription row for the clinician's Stripe Customer, in any status. A Stripe Customer id alone does not establish the path. Console waitlist applies only when the user is not admin/tester and this path is not established; clock expiry never signs the user out to waitlist when the path is established.
_Avoid_: has Stripe customer, ever paid, currently entitled

**Paid billing history**:
Synced Subscription history shows a completed paid Pro billing period (not only trial-style entitlement that never converted). Free rows never count. Canceled seats count only when the paid period continued past trial end (`periodEnd > trialEnd`). Shared rule for Console Subscribe/Renew and Campaign Window, and for Adminboard Assign Free after cancellation (allowed when this is true or the seat is live paid Pro). Never-subscribed Free still uses Assign permanent Free via Access grants.
_Avoid_: ever had a Subscription, Billing Path Established, any canceled Pro

**Cycle plan change**:
Queued paid Pro monthly ↔ yearly switch at the next billing cycle (`stripeScheduleId` / Better Auth `scheduleAtPeriodEnd`). Adminboard Change paid plan schedules through the same Better Auth path as Console (not raw Stripe subscription schedules). Staff release with Cancel Cycle plan change (audit `cancel_cycle_plan_change`); Reactivate keeps its own audit label for cancel-at-period-end undo. Both release/reactivate call Better Auth restore.
_Avoid_: immediate admin price swap, Stripe schedule writer, conflating with Reactivate

**Assigned Variant**:
The clinician's app-owned Pro pricing option (for example `basic` or `early-bird`). Each option is a monthly plus yearly Stripe Price pair on the Pro Product, discovered from Stripe via Price `lookup_key` `{kebab-name}_{interval}` (for example `basic_monthly`, `early-bird_yearly`); the catalog always includes at least `basic`. Stored sparsely when staff assign from Adminboard; missing assignment reads as `basic`. Staff must not change Assigned Variant while the seat is live paid Pro. Catalog Prices are authored in Stripe Dashboard for now; Adminboard assigns only. Distinct from **Coupon**, **Promotion Code**, and **Discount**.
_Avoid_: price tier, custom price, Assigned Price, list-price override (as the term)

**Admin customer paid billing runtime**:
Paid customer mutations (preview/change plan, cancel, reactivate, cancel Cycle plan change, assign Free after cancellation, send Checkout link) enter via `createAdminCustomerBillingRuntime` in `@virtality/auth` (Prisma / Stripe / Cycle plan ports), not a pass-through Action per verb. Promo, catalog, campaign, and **Assigned Variant** keep their Action façades until deepened separately. Access grants and Extension enter via **Admin Entitlement Clock runtime**.
_Avoid_: per-verb paid-billing Action, `@virtality/billing` package (deferred)

**Admin Entitlement Clock runtime**:
Staff mutations that assign permanent Free, grant a timed trial, or apply an Extension enter via `createAdminEntitlementClockRuntime` in `@virtality/auth` (separate Access and Extension Prisma/Stripe ports, plus Renew Prompt rearm). Orpc calls the runtime; do not keep per-verb Action façades. Permanent Free does not rearm Renew Prompt; timed trial uses `rearmForNewClock`; Extension uses `rearmAfterExtension` when the clock end changes.
_Avoid_: per-verb Access/Extension Action, merging Access and Extension into one store as a prerequisite, folding Renew Prompt evaluate into this runtime

**Extension**:
A staff-applied lengthening of the **Entitlement Clock** by days, weeks, or months. For a live seat, the chosen duration is added onto the current clock end (not measured from "now", which would overwrite Remaining Time). Expired, canceled, or never-entitled seats get a new no-card **Trial Subscription** whose clock starts from now plus the chosen duration.
_Avoid_: renewal, top-up, trial extension (as a separate entity name), replace clock with now+N

**Renew Email Trigger**:
An Adminboard-configured row `{ daysBefore, active }` that schedules a renew **System Email** offset before **Entitlement Clock** end. Independent from the in-app list. Empty or all-inactive rows silence email (no separate master switch). Copy stays code-owned.
_Avoid_: Stripe Billing reminder, renew master switch

**Renew In-app Trigger**:
An Adminboard-configured row `{ daysBefore, active }` that schedules an in-app renew prompt offset before **Entitlement Clock** end. Independent from the email list. Empty or all-inactive rows silence in-app (no separate master switch). Chrome copy stays code-owned / `[COPY]`.
_Avoid_: toast blast, global notification toggle

**Renew Prompt Delivery**:
A once-per-channel-per-offset record for the current **Entitlement Clock** epoch (keyed by clock end). Powers System Email and in-app renew chrome; missed offsets catch up once on next evaluation; none after expiry. Extension or successful Subscribe/Renew Checkout that changes the clock end starts a new epoch and drops prior-epoch backlog. Clock-changing paths rearm via `createRenewPromptLifecycle`; evaluate and list-in-app use the same auth runtime.
_Avoid_: Stripe Billing reminder, renew master switch

**Coupon**:
Stripe discount definition (percent or amount off, duration set at creation). Staff and campaigns apply Coupons; clinicians do not type a Coupon id. Distinct from **Free Redeem Code**, **Tester Code**, and **Assigned Variant**.
_Avoid_: Free Redeem Code, Trial Redeem Code, Tester Code, deal, offer code

**Coupon library**:
Adminboard-managed set of reusable **Coupons** that staff create and select when applying a **Discount** to a clinician Subscription.
_Avoid_: coupon catalog, discount list

**Promotion Code**:
Customer-facing redeem string that wraps a **Coupon**, created in Adminboard and entered by the clinician (including mid-cycle on Profile → Billing). Distinct from **Free Redeem Code** and **Tester Code**.
_Avoid_: Free Redeem Code, Trial Redeem Code, Tester Code, Coupon (as the typed string), promo code, voucher

**Promotion Code Delivery**:
Adminboard write-path row that notifies a Console user about a **Promotion Code** (one open row per userId + promotionCodeId). Upserted from Coupon-nested in-app notify; Console chrome for that delivery is out of this map.
_Avoid_: promo inbox, discount notification, code bind

**Discount**:
The live redemption of a **Coupon** (optionally via a **Promotion Code**) on a Subscription (or Checkout-created Subscription). Product rule: one Discount at a time.
_Avoid_: applied coupon (as the term), deal, stacked offers

**Campaign Window**:
An Adminboard-owned start/end interval (at most one scheduled or live) during which Subscribe Checkout auto-attaches a chosen library **Coupon** for clinicians with no prior paid billing. Renew Checkout is excluded. Ending the window stops new attaches; it does not remove **Discounts** already on Subscriptions.
_Avoid_: promo period, sale event, Campaign Coupon (as a separate object type)

**Campaign registry**:
App-owned set of **Coupon** ids ever used as a campaign Coupon. Classifies a live **Discount** as campaign (vs staff). Ids remain after the window ends or the Coupon is swapped mid-window.
_Avoid_: campaign coupon list, active campaign only
