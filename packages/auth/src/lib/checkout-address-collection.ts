/**
 * Billing/VAT address collection for Stripe Checkout. Shared by every
 * Checkout session-create call site — Better Auth's basic `pro` upgrade
 * (auth-instance.ts `getCheckoutSessionParams`) and the Assigned Variant
 * Subscribe path (assigned-variant-subscribe-checkout.ts), which calls
 * `stripeClient.checkout.sessions.create` directly and bypasses that hook.
 *
 * Tax ID is required wherever Stripe supports collecting one, so business
 * name and VAT number are mandatory in those countries; elsewhere Checkout
 * behaves as if the option were absent.
 *
 * Shipping address collection is disabled for now; re-add
 * `shipping_address_collection` (and `shipping: 'auto'` in
 * `customer_update`) here if it needs to come back.
