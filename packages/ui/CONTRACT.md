# Shared UI contract

`@virtality/ui` is the **Shared UI Bucket** for reusable primitives and app-agnostic composites. App-domain widgets stay in **Local App UI** (`apps/<app>/components/ui/`).

Parent PRD: GitHub #14.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Shared UI Bucket** | Canonical reusable UI in `@virtality/ui` |
| **Local App UI** | App-scoped components under `apps/<app>/components/ui/` |
| **Promotion Gate** | Criteria a component must meet before entering the shared bucket |
| **Canonical Shared UI Import** | `@virtality/ui/components/<name>` — required for promoted components |
| **Token Contract** | Shared code uses semantic tokens; apps own concrete values in `globals.css` |
| **Shared UI Ownership** | Behavior/visual contract decisions owned jointly by console + website |
| **Deprecated Local UI Component** | Legacy local file kept temporarily during migration |
| **Priority App Pair** | Console + website — default behavior reference for promotions |

## Promotion Gate

Promote a component only when **all** are true:

1. Used by at least two apps (console, website, or adminboard).
2. No app-domain logic (routing, data fetching, clinical/admin workflows).
3. Visual differences are explainable via theme tokens only — not hardcoded app colors.

Defer overlay/select/menu-class components when migration risk is high.

## Canonical imports

```ts
import { Label } from '@virtality/ui/components/label'
```

- **Do** import promoted components from `@virtality/ui/components/<name>`.
- **Do not** add new imports from `apps/<app>/components/ui/<name>` for promoted components.
- **Do** record the component in `PROMOTED_COMPONENTS` (`@virtality/ui/contract`) when promotion completes.

Machine-readable helpers: `canonicalSharedImport`, `PHASE_1_COMPONENTS`, `PROMOTED_COMPONENTS`.

## Token contract

Shared components:

- Use semantic Tailwind classes (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`, …) — see `SEMANTIC_TOKEN_CLASSES` in `@virtality/ui/lib/semantic-tokens`.
- Must **not** reference app-specific palette tokens (e.g. `vital-blue-*` in console-only branding).
- May use layout/typography utilities (`text-sm`, `font-medium`, `rounded-md`) where not app-branded.

Each app maps semantic tokens in `app/globals.css` (`@theme inline`). Shared code never embeds concrete color values.

## Ownership and conflict resolution

- **Shared UI Ownership**: console + website own promoted behavior and variant contracts.
- **Default**: When implementations diverge, prefer console unless website has a documented UX reason.
- **Adminboard**: Must remain functionally correct; visual drift is acceptable.

Declare the behavior source in promotion PR descriptions.

## Phase 1 batch

`label`, `spinner`, `input`, `textarea`, `separator`, `badge`, `card` — see `PHASE_1_COMPONENTS`.

Breaking API convergence is allowed during phase 1 when needed for a single canonical contract.

## Migration lifecycle

1. Add shared implementation under `packages/ui/src/components/<name>.tsx`.
2. Rewire all consumers to canonical imports.
3. Mark local copies as deprecated (file comment + optional `deprecated` re-export shim).
4. Append `<name>` to `PROMOTED_COMPONENTS`.
5. Run full monorepo `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build`.

Enforcement against new local duplication is added in GitHub #20 after promotions land.

## Implementer checklist

- [ ] Component passes Promotion Gate
- [ ] Shared file has no app imports (`@/`, app-specific env, domain types)
- [ ] Styling uses semantic tokens only
- [ ] All three apps consume via `@virtality/ui/components/<name>`
- [ ] `PROMOTED_COMPONENTS` updated
- [ ] Monorepo type-check + build green
